# Issues

Godot Style's [issues](https://github.com/VinhPhmCng/GodotStylePlugin/issues)

## Existing

1. Sometimes upon opening the project, there is no code highlighting for quoting code blocks ([#2](https://github.com/VinhPhmCng/GodotStylePlugin/issues/2)). In that case:
   
	- Try re-enabling the addon a few times.  
	
	- Give a few tries.

## Addressed
